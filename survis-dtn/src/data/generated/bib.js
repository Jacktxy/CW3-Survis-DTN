        "abstract": "Vehicular delay tolerant network (VDTN) technology uses vehicles on the road as moving nodes to deliver data from source to destination using several intermediate nodes. Efficient data dissemination in VDTN is a difficult problem due to existing trade-offs between several metric variables such as delivery ratio, delay, and overhead ratio. Inclusion of important social network parameters (like community, social strength, trust, friendship, and selfishness) in computation of forwarding probability may help to improve the performance of a routing algorithm. However, different tuning of these parameters results in different outcomes for the metric variables. A proper balancing of these parameters may result in an optimized outcome solving the trade-off between the metric variables. Nonetheless, dependency of the variables on a number of social network parameters and their mutual trade-offs makes this a non-trivial optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to optimize these trade-offs using multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO). The proposed approach provides a set of pareto-optimal solutions also known as non-dominating solutions. Further, based on the requirements of a target application scenario, a specific optimal solution out of the pareto-optimal solution set is delivered using artificial intelligence (AI) technique. The proposed methodology is simulated in a VDTN scenario using the opportunistic network environment (ONE) simulator and Matlab. Furthermore, based on the experimental results, an exhaustive analysis is provided about how the metric variables are affected by the involvement of the social-based parameters. The capabilities of the proposed approach are validated using a statistical comparative analysis of the results. In future, the outcome of the study may play a helpful role to decide the priorities of the network parameters while designing new data dissemination algorithms for VDTN.",

This includes scenarios subject to disruption, disconnection, high delay, and frequent partitioning, such as vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). A new research paradigm called vehicular delay tolerant networks (VDTNs) has emerged. Through relays and store-carry-forward mechanisms, VDTNs can deliver messages without end-to-end connectivity for delay-tolerant applications. This paper provides a detailed study of recently proposed routing schemes for VDTNs and comparative analysis based on metrics like forwarding criteria, infrastructure usage, location-awareness, and topology assumptions.

        "abstract": "Nowadays, wireless networks are witnessing several deployments in various extreme environments where they suffer from different levels of link disruptions depending on the severity of the operating conditions. In all cases, their operation requirements are differently altered and their performance is negatively affected rendering them heterogeneous by nature. In the open literature, these networks are known as Intermittently Connected Networks (ICNs). The existing Internet protocols fail to operate properly in the context of ICNs, thus raising a variety of new challenging problems that are attracting the attention of the networking research community. Delay-/Disruption-Tolerant Networking emerged as a highly active area of research where networking experts compete in addressing the various ICN problems. Over time, unicast routing, one of the architectural key components common to all ICNs, became an almost independent field of research in which significant efforts continue to be invested. In contrast, network architectural designs, scheduling and forwarding issues dating from the early days of Inter-Planetary Networks (IPNs) have received relatively little attention and accumulate numerous pending challenges. Moreover, the gap caused by the lack of accurate ICN mathematical models is still large irrespective of some of the appreciated seminal works in this direction. This paper sheds the light over the latest advancements in each of the above-mentioned research sectors and highlight pending open issues in each of them.",

        "abstract": "The number of disasters has increased over the past decade where these calamities significantly affect the functionality of communication networks. In the context of 6G, airborne and spaceborne networks offer hope in disaster recovery to serve the underserved and to be resilient in calamities. Therefore, our paper reviews the state-of-the-art literature on post-disaster wireless communication networks and provides insights for the future establishment of such networks. In particular, we first give an overview of the works investigating the general procedures and strategies for facing any large-scale disaster. Then, we present technological solutions for post-disaster communications, such as the recovery of the terrestrial infrastructure, installing aerial networks, and using spaceborne networks. Afterwards, we shed light on the technological aspects of post-disaster networks, primarily the physical and networking issues. We present the literature on channel modeling, coverage and capacity, radio resource management, localization, and energy efficiency in the physical layer part, and discuss the integrated space-air-ground architectures, routing, delay-tolerant/software-defined networks, and edge computing in the networking layer part. This paper also includes interesting simulation results which can provide practical guidelines about the deployment of ad hoc network architectures in emergency scenarios. Finally, we present several promising research directions, namely backhauling, cache-enabled and intelligent reflective surface-enabled networks, placement optimization of aerial base stations (ABSs), and the mobility-related aspects that come into play when deploying aerial networks, such as planning their trajectories and the consequent handovers (HOs).",

        "abstract": "The sixth generation (6G) wireless communication network presents itself as a promising technique that can be utilized to provide a fully data-driven network evaluating and optimizing the end-to-end behavior and big volumes of a real-time network within a data rate of Tb/s. In addition, 6G adopts an average of 1000+ massive number of connections per person in one decade (2030 virtually instantaneously). The data-driven network is a novel service paradigm that offers a new application for the future of 6G wireless communication and network architecture. It enables ultra-reliable and low latency communication (URLLC) enhancing information transmission up to around 1 Tb/s data rate while achieving a 0.1 millisecond transmission latency. The main limitation of this technique is the computational power available for distributing with big data and greatly designed artificial neural networks. The work carried out in this paper aims to highlight improvements to the multi-level architecture by enabling artificial intelligence (AI) in URLLC providing a new technique in designing wireless networks. This is done through the application of learning, predicting, and decision-making to manage the stream of individuals trained by big data. The secondary aim of this research paper is to improve a multi-level architecture. This enables user level for device intelligence, cell level for edge intelligence, and cloud intelligence for URLLC. The improvement mainly depends on using the training process in unsupervised learning by developing data-driven resource management. In addition, improving a multi-level architecture for URLLC through deep learning (DL) would facilitate the creation of a data-driven AI system, 6G networks for intelligent devices, and technologies based on an effective learning capability. These investigational problems are essential in addressing the requirements in the creation of future smart networks. Moreover, this work provides further ideas on several research gaps between DL and 6G that are up-to-date unknown.",

CBTC is the direction of future train control systems. Complex channel condition and frequent handoff can severely affect urban rail CBTC train-ground communication performance, and consequently affect CBTC operation efficiency. Current research regarding CBTC does not consider the impact of train-ground communications on train control performance. This paper studies the joint optimization of communication and control in CBTC systems. With the objective to minimize the optimal operation profile tracking error and energy consumption, linear quadratic cost is defined as the control performance measure. In order to ensure train operation safety, the optimization model puts constraints on train control actions related to safety. Moreover, based on the stochastic channel characteristics and the real-time train position information, handoff decision and train control policy are jointly optimized using deep reinforcement learning. Extensive simulation results based on real-field channel measurements illustrate that the proposed optimization method can significantly improve the train control performance in CBTC systems, and CBTC systems need to sacrifice part of performance to ensure system safety.",
